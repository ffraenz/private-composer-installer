This is a [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) plugin offering a way to reference private package URLs within `composer.json` and `composer.lock`. It outsources sensitive dist URL parts (license keys, tokens) into environment variables or a `.env` file typically ignored by version control. This is especially useful when you can't use [Private Packagist](https://packagist.com/) or [Basic HTTP Auth](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/authentication-for-private-packages.md#http-basic) because the source of a package is not in your control. This repository is inspired by [acf-pro-installer](https://github.com/PhilippBaschke/acf-pro-installer).

## Quick overview

- This plugin is compatible with both Composer 2.x (latest) and 1.x.
- When installing or updating a package, the dist URL `{%VERSION}` placeholder gets replaced by the version set in the package. In Composer 1 the dist URL version gets fulfilled before it is added to `composer.lock`.
- Before downloading the package, `{%VARIABLE}` formatted placeholders get replaced by their corresponding environment variables in the dist URL. Env vars will never be stored inside `composer.lock`.
- If an environment variable is not available for the given placeholder the plugin trys to read it from the `.env` file in the working directory or in one of the parent directories. The `.env` file gets parsed by [vlucas/phpdotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv).
- If an environment variable can't be resolved a `MissingEnvException` gets thrown.
- Package dist URLs with no `{%VARIABLE}` formatted placeholders get ignored by this plugin.

## Examples

### Arbitrary private packages

Add the desired private package to the `repositories` field inside `composer.json`. Find more about Composer repositories in the [Composer documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#repositories). Specify the exact version to install, and use `{%VARIABLE}` placeholders to specify any sensitive tokens in your `.env` file.

```json
{
  "type": "package",
  "package": {
    "name": "package-name/package-name",
    "version": "REPLACE_WITH_LATEST_PACKAGE_VERSION",
    "dist": {
      "type": "zip",
      "url": "https://example.com/package-name.zip?key={%PACKAGE_KEY}&version={%VERSION}"
    },
    "require": {
      "ffraenz/private-composer-installer": "^5.0"
    }
  }
}
```

Provide the private package dist URL inside the `.env` file:

```
PACKAGE_KEY=pleasedontusethiskey
```

Let Composer require the private package:

```bash
composer require "package-name/package-name:*"
```

### WordPress plugins

WordPress plugins can be installed using the package type `wordpress-plugin` in conjunction with the `composer/installers` installer. In this example we are installing the ACF Pro plugin. Add following entry to the [repositories](https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#repositories) field inside `composer.json` and set the desired ACF Pro version.

```json
{
  "type": "package",
  "package": {
    "name": "advanced-custom-fields/advanced-custom-fields-pro",
    "version": "REPLACE_WITH_LATEST_ACF_VERSION",
    "type": "wordpress-plugin",
    "dist": {
      "type": "zip",
      "url": "https://connect.advancedcustomfields.com/v2/plugins/download?p=pro&k={%PLUGIN_ACF_KEY}==&t={%VERSION}"
    },
    "require": {
      "composer/installers": "^1.4",
      "ffraenz/private-composer-installer": "^5.0"
    }
  }
}
```

Provide the ACF Pro key inside the `.env` file. To get this key, login to your [ACF account](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/my-account/) and scroll down to 'Licenses & Downloads'.

```
PLUGIN_ACF_KEY=pleasedontusethiskey
```

Let Composer require ACF Pro:

```bash
composer require "advanced-custom-fields/advanced-custom-fields-pro:*"
```

## Configuration

The configuration options listed below may be added to the root configuration in `composer.json` like so:

```json
{
  "name": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "require": {
  },
  "extra": {
    "private-composer-installer": {
      "dotenv-path": ".",
      "dotenv-name": ".env"
    }
  }
}
```

### dotenv-path

Dotenv file directory relative to the root package (where `composer.json` is located). By default dotenv files are expected to be in the root package folder or in any of the parent folders.

### dotenv-name

Dotenv file name. Defaults to `.env`.

## Dependencies

This package heavily depends on [vlucas/phpdotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv) to load environment variables "automagically". This may cause version conflicts if your project already depends on it. Refer to this table to set the version of `private-composer-installer` accordingly or consider upgrading.

| `vlucas/phpdotenv` | `private-composer-installer` |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `^4.1`, `^5.2`     | `^5.0`                       |
| `^4.0`             | `^4.0`                       |
| `^3.0`             | `^3.0`, `^2.0`               |
| `^2.2`             | `^1.0`                       |

## Development

Install Composer dependencies:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm composer composer install
```

Before pushing changes to the repository run tests and check coding standards using following command:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm composer composer test
```
